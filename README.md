# Predictive Analytics for Underserved Student Retention and Persistence
This study utilizes a machine learning framework to predict student retention and persistence
using a combination of institutional and individual student data. The research addresses the
following questions:
1. Which features are most predictive of student retention and persistence, respectively?
2. How accurately can we predict a studentâ€™s likelihood of discontinuing their studies using
information from a combination of the institutional data and student data?
3. What machine learning approaches are most suitable for predicting student retention and
persistence, respectively?
4. How do the factors influencing student retention compare with those affecting student
persistence, and what are the implications for predictive modeling in educational settings?
